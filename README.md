# Password manager in C++
an attempt to expand my c++ skills into encryption using cryptopp

once im back in my dorm room after easter ill keep working on it 

**Features**

- lets user input/display/delete passwords and encrypts/decypts them using a salt and sha-256
- added a function to generate a random secure password
- a masterpassword for the app stored in isFirstRun.txt
- if its the first run then check if isFirstRun.txt doesnt exist then it will create one and prompt user to create master password

# Agenda / improvements-to-be-made

- a GUI like a windows application instead of terminal
- add a password strength checker
- a more secure storage for passwords
- automatic timeout/logout
- backup and restore function
- password history function
- 2FA
- password sharing
- security audit
- cross-platform (maybe using swift for IOS)
- user customizable settings
- secure note storage
- import / export function
- browser extention/integration(!!!)
- some sort of captcha

I am an economy student and this is my hobby so it may take some time to finalize this project. i ask your patient if youre serious about using this app.

this is my biggest project so far and intend to share the entire source code in the future!
